# Do your own work!

* Do not copy code
* Do not give other people your code to copy
* Working together is fine, but each person should do their own coding.

## Other stuff

* Watch the file names.  Use the name specified in the assignment.
* I strongly suggest loading the VS Code Extension *Code Spell Checker* by Street Side Software.
   * This isn't an English class, but watch you spelling, especially on output.
* The summary should be a full sentence, not a cryptic note.  It does not need to be long in most cases.  Just a sentence or maybe two.
