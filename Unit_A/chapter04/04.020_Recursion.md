# 04.020 Recursion

Recursion is a function that calls itself.

Most of the recursion we have done is *Direct Recursion.*  In direct recursion the function calls itself directly.

There is also *Indirect Recursion* where a group of functions call each other and the references can be circular.

When looking at a recursive algorithm be able to identify the *Base Case* that stops the recursion.  Bad things happen (like a program or computer crash) if recursion runs too many times.
