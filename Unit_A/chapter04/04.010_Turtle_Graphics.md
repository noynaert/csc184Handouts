# 04.010 Turtle Graphics

[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/)

Caution: Python 3 changed turtle graphics.  Be careful searching the Internet because turtle graphics changes in Python3.  Some tutorials may not work because initializing turtle graphics is different.


Note that we were mainly learning turtle graphics in order to play with functions, programming logic, and some recursion.

## Things to know about turtle graphics

* import turtle
* create an instance of a turtle (That is, declare a turtle variable, as in `yertle = new turtle.Turtle()` )
* Turtle.done()
* forward() or fd() functions
* turnleft() and turnright() functions
    * use degrees by default
    * know common angles like 45째, 90째, 180째, 360째
* Be able to do a simple program like the following

```python
# square.py

# draws a square as a function

import turtle

#function to draw a square of specified length
def drawSquare(t, length):
    # t is a turtle
    # length is the length of the side
    t.pencolor('red')
    t.forward(length)
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(length)
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(length)
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(length)
    t.left(90)

### main
tubby = turtle.Turtle()
tubby.right(45)
sideLength = int(input ("How long is one side?"))
drawSquare(tubby, sideLength)

turtle.done()
```
