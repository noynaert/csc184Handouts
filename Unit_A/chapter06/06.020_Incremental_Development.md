# 06.020 Incremental Development

* Big problems are hard to solve
* Small problems are easier to solve

## Incremental Development

Incremental Development means breaking a large problem into small problems.  Then solve one problem at a time.

## Functions and Incremental Development

A function should do one thing.  

Get a function working and have confidence in its results.  Then trust it in the future.

## Scaffolding

Scaffolding is code used during development, but it will not be part of the final program.  

For example, you might create the following scaffolding in order to test the absolute_value(x) function.

```python
y = float(input('Enter a number, or 0 to quit '))
while(y):
    z = absolute_value(y)
    print(f"{y}'s absolute value is {z}")
    y = float(input('Enter a number, or 0 to quit '))

print("Done!")
```

## Design Pattern

A design pattern is a standard way of coding something.  

Design patterns save time once you know them.  Generating the structure becomes almost automatic (or possibly fully automatic)

Design patterns also help prevent logic errors on tricky structures such as loops.

### Design Pattern for a while loop

Note the pattern in the while loop in the scaffolding.

The input statement is used to "prime" the loop before the first time the `while` statement.  

The same statement is executed as the last statement in the loop to set up the next test.
