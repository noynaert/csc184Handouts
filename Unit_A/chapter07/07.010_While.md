#07.010 While Statement

# Iteration

Iteration means executing a block of code more than one time.

The basic iteration statement in most language is the `while` loop.

There are other forms of iteration we will cover later.

## Syntax of the while statement

```text
while CONDITION:
   BLOCK
```

See the "Design Pattern" for while loops at [https://github.com/noynaert/csc184Handouts/blob/main/Unit_A/chapter06/06.020_Incremental_Development.md](https://github.com/noynaert/csc184Handouts/blob/main/Unit_A/chapter06/06.020_Incremental_Development.md)

## A hidden iterator

We have actually covered two methods of iteration.

Recursion is actually a form of iteration.  In fact, there is a computer language called "Lisp" and recursion is the only way to iterate.
