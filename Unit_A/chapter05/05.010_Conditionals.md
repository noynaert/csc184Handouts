## Boolean data type

In Python "bool" expressions have a value of either True or False

True and False are capitalized in Python

```text
>>> type(1 > 0)
<class 'bool'>
```

## Relational Operators

Operator|Meaning
:---:|:---
<|Less Than
<=|Less than or Equal to
\>|Greater than
\>=|Greater than or Equal to
==|Equals
!=|Not Equal to

### English and operators

* "At least" usually means >= or <=
* "Thru" usually means <= or >=
* "Over" usually means >
* "Up to" usually means <
* more????

## Gotcha:  Testing equality of real numbers

In almost all cases, do not use == and != with float data types.  It invites problems with rounding errors.

```
>>> (1.1 + 1.1 + 1.1) == 3.3
False
```
If you need to test for equality, it is usually better to take the absolute value of the difference.  If the difference is smaller than some small number (often called EPSILON) then the numbers are "close enough" to be equal.

```
>>> EPSILON = .0005
>>> abs(3.3 - (1.1+1.1+1.1)) < EPSILON
True
```
The other solution is to avoid using == and !=.  Generally things like <= and >= are considered as OK, but be aware of whether even these are appropriate.

## Logical Operators

Operator|Meaning
:---:|:---
and|And
or|Or
not|Not

Note that "or" is not an exclusive or

## Truth Tables

### and

"If you wash the dishes AND clean your room I will give you $10.

Wash the Dishes|Clean your room| AND
:---:|:---:|:---:
False|False|$0
False|True|$0
True|False|$0
True|True|$10

#### Same thing, using 0 for false and 1 for true

Wash the Dishes|Clean your room| AND
:---:|:---:|:---:
0|0|0
0|1|0
1|0|0
1|1|1

### or

"If you wash the dishes OR clean your room I will give you $10.

Wash the Dishes|Clean your room| OR
:---:|:---:|:---:
False|False|$0
False|True|$10
True|False|$10
True|True|$10

#### Same thing, using 0 for false and 1 for true

Wash the Dishes|Clean your room| OR
:---:|:---:|:---:
0|0|0
0|1|1
1|0|1
1|1|1

Traditionally truth tables count down in binary to avoid missing options.

## Ranges

Suppose we want an age range where the person must be at least 18 but less than 22

Python has two ways of coding this.

### Range, method 1 (conventional way in most languages)

```python
ageEligible = (age >=18) and (age < 22)
```

### Range, method 2 (shorter, more mathmatical Python way)
```python
ageEligible = (18 <= age < 22)
```

## General warning

***Be very careful with logic***

* Avoid not except in simple and intuitive situations
* Avoid "reversing" the logic, especially on ranges 
    * DeMorgan's theorum is relevant, but beyond the scope of what we are talking about
* Try to keep logic as simple and intuitive as possible.  Make it simple in English, then code it that way.
* Avoid complex compound logic
  * Break components down into boolean variables if possible
  * Use nest if and chained if statements to simplify logic
* Use a lot of parenthesis to clarify precedence, even if they are not necessary


## `if` statements

```python
x = float(input("Type a number: "))
print("The value of X is",x)
if x > 0:
    print("X is positive")

print("I am done.")
```

## if
x = float(input("Type a number: "))
if x > 0:
    print("X is positive")
else
    print("X is not positive")
    print("It might be zero or negative")
print("I am done.")
```

## Nested if statements

## Chained if statements with `elif`
