05.040 Match...case Statement

Many languages have a select statement that is an alternative way of coding long elif: type of structures.

Beginning with Python 3.10, Python has a match...case statement.

However, many computers, including many school computers may not have 3.10 installed.  Therefore we will not be concerned with match...case this semester.
