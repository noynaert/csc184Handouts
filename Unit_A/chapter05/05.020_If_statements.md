# 05.020 If statements

## Most basic form of `if` statement

```python
number = int(input("Type an integer "))

if number > 0:
    print(f'{number} is a positive ')
    
print ("Done!")
```

### Syntax
if <em>boolean expression</em> :<br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>indented block of code</em>

The Boolean Expression may be a simple variable, or may use relational and logical operators

```python
if age>=18 && age<=24:
    print(f'{age} is in range')

print("Done")
```

## `else:`

The else clause is optional.  The block of code only executes if the boolean expression is false (or "falsey")

Note that if there is an else clause, then either one of the clauses will always be executed.

```python
if age >= 16:
    print('Old enough to drive')
    print('Please drive responsibly.')
else:
    print('Not old enough to drive')
    print('But you will be old enough before you know it!')
```

## `elif` <em>boolean expression</em> `:`

Elif is a combination of else and an if.  It allows "chaining" of conditional statements.

```python
temperature = float(input('What is the current temperature in Fahrenheit? '))
print(f'The temperature is {temperature} degrees fahrenheit.')

if temperature > 90:
    print('Go Swimming')
elif temperature > 60:
   print('Take a walk')
elif temperature > 32:
    print('Go hiking')
elif temperature > 0:
    print('Go ice skating')
else:
    print('Play cards by the fire')
    
print('Done')
```

The final else is optional.  It will only execute if none of the conditions are true.

## Nesting conditionals

if statements may occur within the `if:`, `else:` and `elif:` blocks of code.

```python
temperature = float(input('What is the current temperature in Fahrenheit? '))
print(f'The temperature is {temperature} degrees fahrenheit.')

if temperature > 90:
    raining = input('Is it raining?')
    if raining == 'yes':
        print('Go for a walk in the rain')
    else:
        print('Go swimming')
elif temperature > 60:
   print('Take a walk')
elif temperature > 32:
    print('Go hiking')
elif temperature > 0:
    inches = float(input('How many inches of snow is on the ground? '))
    enoughSnow = inches > 1.0
    if enoughSnow:
        print('Go sledding')
    else:
        print('Go ice skating')
else:
    print('Play cards by the fire')
    
print('Done')
```

## Problem

Grades are assigned according to the following scale.

Score|Grade
:---:|:---:
90 and above|A
80 up to 90|B
70 up to 80|C
60 up to 70|D
Below 60|F

Don't just print the variable.  Set a variable called `grade` to the appropriate letter.  So if the student scored 90 or above then the indented block should be `grade = 'A'`
