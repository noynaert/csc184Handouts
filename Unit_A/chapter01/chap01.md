# Chapter 01 -- The Way of the Program

Right now a lot of stuff is getting thrown at you.  For right now we will just hit a few points in this chapter.  We will talk about the other issues in this chapter later in the course.

## Programming

This course is about writing programs. 

A *program* is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to do some task.  That task can be a lot of different things.  Examples include:

* The results of a calculation
* Play or manage a game
* Create a picture or graphic
* Generate a summary report based on some data stored in a database.

This semester we will learn to write programs.

## Problem Solving

Writing programs involves problem solving.

Programming is like a game.  There are rules specified by the programming language.  The challenge of programming is to decide how to get the computer to do a certain task by using the programming language.

We don't solve large problems.  Most programs involve solving a lot of small programs.  Taken together the small solutions solve a bigger problem.

## The Interpreter

Computers use a language that is very inconvenient for human users.  Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript are examples of languages that are more similar to human languages.  Each language is a little different, but they are each different in their own ways.

An *interpreter* is a computer program that takes user instruction in a programming-like language like Python and translates it into a language the computer can understand.

You may also run into something called a *compiler.*  Compilers do the same basic job of translating human languages into computer languages.  Compilers work in a slightly different way than interpreters.  But for now we can ignore the differences.
