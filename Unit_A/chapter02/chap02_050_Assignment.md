# 02.050 Assignment

## = is the Assignment Operator

*** Do not read = as "equals." ***

Read = as "takes on the value of"

```    
    x = x + 1
```

## Only a variable may appear on the left side of the = operator.  

The statement ```x = x + 1``` is valid, but ```x + 1 = x```  is not.

The assignment operator returns a value.  In python this means we can do several assignments at the same time.

```
x = y = 5
```

Why isn't the following statement valid?

```
x = y + 1 = 5 # This is invalid!
```
