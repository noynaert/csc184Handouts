# 06.010 Fruitful Functions

Fruitful functions return a value.

## `return` Statement

The return statement marks the last statement in the function that executes.

In a fruitful function a value is placed after the word return.  

## Good programming style -- A single return

One principle of "Structured Programming" is that a block of code should have one entry point and one exit point.  The entry point should be at the top and the exit point should be at the bottom.

### Bad code from the textbook:

<div style="background-color:#ffcccb">

```python
def absolute_value(x):
    if x < 0:
        return -x
    else
        return x
```

</div>
