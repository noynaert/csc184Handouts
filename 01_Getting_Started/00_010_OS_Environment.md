# 00.010 OS Environment for this course

## Assumed skill level

This is an introductory course in programming.  No previous programming experience is assumed.

What is assumed is that you have some level of skill with computers in general, and with your operating system.  At a minimum you should know how to do the following things on your computer system

* Create folders or directories
* Install software
* Open a terminal or command prompt
* Move files and directories
* Upload and Download files

## Operating System

You should be able to do this course in Linux, Windows, or MacOS.  However, I will only be able to help with Linux and Windows.

For this course I am assuming that you are using a reasonably current version of your operating system.

* Windows 10 or Windows 11 should be fine.  No one should be using Windows 7.  And never admit in public to ever having used Windows 8.
* On Linux you should be using something derived from Ubuntu 20.04 or later, or Fedora 32 or later.  Ubuntu 18.04 would work, but it will tend to default to Python2 instead of Python3.


### Linux 

I encourage all students to gain experience with the Linux operating system, especially at the command line.

If you are not experienced with Linux, then Ubuntu with the standard Gnome desktop or Mint with the Cinnamon desktop are good choices for your first system.  For somewhat experienced users, you might want to try Fedora or POP!OS.  

## Bash

I encourage all students to get experience with Linux and the Bash shell.  Linux and Mac users will have the Bash shell as their default command prompt.

Windows Users are encouraged to set up the Windows Environment for Linux.

### Directories

VS Code and good practice dictate that you have good discipline in proper use of directories (also known as folders).  You should create one directory (or folder) for this course and keep all files within that folder.  Each homework assignment should be in its own directory.  I will remind you of this on the first couple of assignments, then assume that you follow the practice of creating a new directory for each assignment.  

## The command line

No matter what your system, we will be using the command line (or "terminal window") this semester.  The terminal window is also a built-in feature of VS Code.
